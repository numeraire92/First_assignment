<h1 id="the-value-of-life-in-legal-context-survey-and-critique">The Value of Life in Legal Context: Survey and Critique</h1>
<h2 id="main-questions">Main questions:</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Appropriate value of life to establish <strong>efficient incentives for safety for deterrence and accident prevention</strong>?</li>
<li>What is the appropriate value of life from the standpoint of the principles of optimal insurance and appropriate compensation of accident victims?</li>
<li>If our objective is to make the victim whole, as in tort liability context involving nonmonetary damages, what should be the appropriate level of compensation?</li>
<li>If the regulatory expenditures to save lives are very unproductive, is there any level at which their effect on risk leads to the loss of statistical life rather than a health benefit?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="measures">Measures</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Value of statistical lives</p>
<p>What is that person's willingness to pay to eliminate some small risk of death? (WTP of those affected by the risk reduction in the context of policies)</p>
<p>This is appropriate for deterrence rather than compensation.</p></li>
<li><p>Insurance and human capital measures</p>
<p>The present value of the earnings of the individual exposed to the risk.</p>
<p>This measure is more appropriate for insurance and compensation to the accident victim.</p></li>
<li><p>The Make Whole Principle</p>
<p>Make the victim &quot;whole&quot; after an economic loss by compensating for the value of the loss that has been incurred. This approach not only provides for full compensation of the loss but also establishes appropriate incentives for accident avoidance in situations in which all accident losses are monetary. [...] Optimal insurance will provide for sufficient compensation to equate the marginal utililty of income in both the accident and the marginal utility of income in both the accident and the no accident state of the world.</p>
<p>[...] If there is no such diminution in marginal utility, then the total value of the compensation an accident victim receives for the financial loss plus any pain and suffering compensation should be sufficient to make the victim whole.</p>
<p>[...] There is consequently no economic justification for levels of postaccident insruance compensation that will restore the fatally injured or seriously impaired accident victims to their preaccident welfare level.</p></li>
<li><p>Risk-Risk analysis</p>
<p>Regulations may create risks as well as reduce them. In some cases, there may be direct risk effects of the regulation. &quot;Risks caused by regulations.&quot;</p>
<p>Health-health analysis <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457501000847">based on this</a>: Expenditure on a particular health policy or safety regulation must be financed in one way or another, which will results in an opportunity cost or income effect leaving less resources for other health and safety promoting activities in society. Thus, we will have an effect that reduxces safety and health benefits induced by that income loss. [...] One way of esimating the income loss that induces one death, which we call the value of an induced death (VOID), is to estimate it as a multiple of the traditional value to acert a statistical death, also named the value of a statistical life (VOSL).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="value-of-statistical-lives">Value of statistical lives</h2>
<p>Supposed that we had 10,000 respondents, each of whom faced a 1/10,000 risk of death. Overall, there would be one statistical death expected in this group. If each person is willing to pay $500 to eliminate the risk, a total of $5 million coould be raised to eliminate the one statistical death to the entire group. Thus, $5 million would be the value of a statistical life in this situation.</p>
<p>[...] Smith suggested that workers would need to be compensated for jobs that posed additional risk; otherwise, these positions would not be as attractive as safer job alternatives. - Graphical example on the trade off of the wage and risk of a job. (XX curve - from the market optimums vs. individual preferences - they provide different risk compensation rates for a given person)</p>
<h2 id="regulatory-applications-of-the-value-of-life">Regulatory Applications of the Value of Life</h2>
<p>The U.S. Office of Management and Budget now recommends the use of the value of life methodology for benefit assessment for all proposed federal regulations. While agencies now routinely assess benefits using these value of life figures, the result of the analysis do not always bind government policy. In most instances, the restrictive legislative mandates of the regulatory agencies require that they issues protective regulations irrespective of benefit-cost balancing. [...] The different cost per life for U.S. policies.</p>
<h3 id="salient-policy-issues">Salient policy issues</h3>
<p>Heterogeneity in the value of life should be incorporated in the calculations as well given the context of the regulations. Value of life may differ based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>individual age: the value of the years that are gained because of the risk reduction differs on the actual age.</li>
<li>income: WTP is different for different income groups (however, government imposed distinctions would be controversial - a consumer borne solution would be more fit)</li>
<li>quality of life years at risk and the whether the risks are voluntary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="value-of-life-in-the-courts">Value of Life in the courts</h2>
<p>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>As the paper points out, the value of statistical life can be different if ceteris paribus the income is different. This would mean that the same policy reducing the health issues from environment degradation by tackling the pollution can be efficient based on a cost-benefit analysis in a developed country while not efficient in a developing country. Does this mean that the value of the environment is lower in the developing country than in the developed country?</p></li>
<li><p>Given this problem and that these calculations based on the value statistical life (WTP) are susceptible to underestimate future generations valuations (as described in the paper) is it rational for the US. regulatory bodies to issue protective regulations regardless the implications of the cost-benefit analyses?</p></li>
